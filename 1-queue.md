#Queue Data Structure

##Introduction
What are Queues? They are a type of data structure that uses the idea of "First in, first out" when adding and removing data from the queue. A quick example of the "FIFO" method is when a group of people get into a line for something.


###What is First in, first out?

Let's say there is one person in line for cottton candy at a State Fair. Then another person gets in line behind them. The vendor then yells out, "NEXT PERSON PLEASE!" Who would be the next person to buy their cotton candy? Definitley the first person in line! This is how the "First in, first out" method works with queues, the next person in line is the one to be removed, or the one at the "front of the line". The data will always be flowing one way, almost like a stream. 

###When to use a Queue?
The main factor when deciding whether your program should us a queue, is to ask yourself, "Do I want my data structure to remove items in the order that they are added?" If the answer is no, it may be best to use a different data structure, but if the answer is yes, then queues would work great!
